The color pallete was created on Muzli colors, the colors used are quite muted creating a relaxed experience for users. The images used throughout the website is where the inspiration for the colors came from, this creates a consistent and cohesive theme. The 'Raleway' and Lato fonts were chosen for their elegance and warmth.
