# User Experience

## Design

Wireframes were made in Balsamiq to ensure a clear and easy development process, however please note that the final design may not match these wireframes exactly as many iterations were explored. The color palette was created using Muzli colors, the colors used are quite muted creating a relaxed experience for users. The images used throughout the website inspired the color scheme, this created a consistent and cohesive theme. The 'Raleway' and 'Lato' fonts were chosen for their elegance and warmth. These fonts are also highly legible, making them a great choice. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font.

# Site Structure

There are currently three pages on the website: Home, About me and Book a class there is also a thank you page to which  the user will be redirected once they submit the form. The landing page is the home page. The other pages are easily visible and accessible in the navigation bar at the top. The logo which is also at the top of the page, when clicked, brings the user back to the homepage. 

## Features

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar shows links to each of the pages. It is fully responsive, turning into a hamburger menu on smaller screen sizes.

### Hero section/ landing content
The content you see when you click on the website is an attractive hero image and hero text which gives the user immediate knowledge of the purpose of the site.

![hero section](assets/images/readme-images/hero-readme.png)


### Homepage
The homepage is made up of the hero section which is an attactive image and text, underneath this, there are three images with three concise descriptions of different yoga styles to give the user information on the classes provided. At the bottom of the page there is a call to action (button) which allows the user to book a class. The button is linked to the book a class page.

### About me page

The about me page has a brief personal description about Billy, underneath this there are three cards containing images with a description of Billy's qualifications, skills and expertise. The background is calming and the style simple.

![About me page](assets/images/readme-images/aboutme-readme.png)

### Book a class page 

The book a class page has the same background as the About me page for consistency in the styling, the page consists of a simple-to-use form that has no unnecessary questions. There are clear prompts shown to the user if they don't enter the required information before submitting. Once the user has submitted the form they are redirected to a 'thank you' page which enhances the user's experience.

![Book a class page](assets/images/readme-images/bookaclass-readme.png)

### Thank you page

The thank you page has a thank you note and is styled the same as the other pages, its purpose is to thank the user for submitting the form, enhance the user experience, and inform the user their submission was successful.

![Thank you page](assets/images/readme-images/thankyou-readme.png)

### Footer
The footer is located at the bottom of the page and contains links to social media accounts using attractive icons.

![footer](assets/images/readme-images/footer-readme.png)

### Responsiveness

The site is responsive from 270px and functions on a range of screen sizes. It was built prioritising mobile's first and media queries were applied to ensure responsiveness on larger screen sizes. 

### Accessibility
Aria-lables, alt text, color contrast and font selections were thoughtfully chosen to ensure an inclusive and accesible user experience.

### Future features
 I would like to implement the following features in the future to allow for an improved user experience:
 - Sign up and Login feature to allow users a personalised experience.
 - A feature which shows users previous classes and upcoming classes.
 - A loyalty scheme where the user gets every 6th class free if they sign up on the site, this would increase customer retention.
 - A large library of video and images showing snippets of classes and yoga poses.

# Bugs

Debugging and problem solving was done consistently throughout the development process.

List of some issues that arose:

* The hero image wasn't 100% in width and image was in px which was stretching across the screen and didn't know what to priotritise- change to %.
* The hero image was not showing up when I deployed for the first time, I fixed the file path to solve this issue.
* When the text was changed on the homepage under the title Yin Yoga, the text underneath Vinyasa yoga spilled out, I fixed this issue by setting media queries with width values. 
* There was an error in my HTML, I had an anchor tag nested within my button element, I realised this was an issue and fixed it by removing the button element.
* The footer on the about me page was twice the height it should be, fixed this by setting the background image at 100vh which pushed the footer down.
* The hamburger drop down menu when opened was covering some content, I fixed this by adding some padding.
