# User Experience

## Design

Wireframes were made in Balsamiq to ensure a clear and easy development process. The color palette was created on Muzli colors, the colors used are quite muted creating a relaxed experience for users. The images used throughout the website is where the inspiration for the colors came from, this creates a consistent and cohesive theme. The 'Raleway' and 'Lato' fonts were chosen for their elegance and warmth. These fonts are also highly legible, making them a great choice. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font.
