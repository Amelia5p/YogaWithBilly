# User Experience

## Design

Wireframes were made in Balsamiq to ensure a clear and easy development process. The color palette was created on Muzli colors, the colors used are quite muted creating a relaxed experience for users. The images used throughout the website is where the inspiration for the colors came from, this creates a consistent and cohesive theme. The 'Raleway' and 'Lato' fonts were chosen for their elegance and warmth. These fonts are also highly legible, making them a great choice. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font.

# Site Structure

There are currently three pages on the website: Home, About me and Book a class. The landing page is the home page. The other pages are easily visible and accessible in the navigation bar at the top. The logo which is also at the top of the page, when clicked, brings the user back to the homepage. Also, when a user books a class, they are redirected to a page which thanks them.

## Features

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar shows links to each of the pages. It is fully responsive, turning into a hamburger menu on smaller screen sizes.

### Homepage
The homepage is made up of the hero section which is an attactive image and text, underneath this, there are three images with three concise descriptions of different yoga styles to give the user information on the classes provided. At the bottom of the page there is a call to action (button) which allows the user to book a class. The button is linked to the book a class page.

### About me page

The about me page has a brief personal description about Billy, underneath this there are three cards containing images with a description of Billy's qualifications, skills and expertise. The background is calming and the style simple.

### Book a class page 

The book a class page has the same background as the About me page for consistency in the styling, the page consists of a simple-to-use form that has no uneccesary questions. There are clear prompts shown to the user if they don't enter the required information before submitting. Once the user has submited the form they are redirected to a 'thank you' page which enhances the user's experience.

### Footer
The footer is located at the bottom of the page and contains links to social media accounts using attractive icons.

### Future features
 I would like to implement the following features in the future to allow for an improved user experience:
 - Sign up and Login feature to allow users a personalised experience.
 - A feature which shows users previous classes and upcoming classes.
 - A loyalty scheme where the user gets every 6th class free if they sign up on the site.
