# User Experience

## Design

Wireframes were made in Balsamiq to ensure a clear and easy development process. The color palette was created on Muzli colors, the colors used are quite muted creating a relaxed experience for users. The images used throughout the website is where the inspiration for the colors came from, this creates a consistent and cohesive theme. The 'Raleway' and 'Lato' fonts were chosen for their elegance and warmth. These fonts are also highly legible, making them a great choice. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font.

# Site Structure

There are currently three pages on the website: Home, About me and Book a class. The landing page is the home page. The other pages are easily visible and accessible in the navigation bar at the top. The logo which is also at the top of the page, when clicked, brings the user back to the homepage. Also, when a user books a class, they are redirected to a page which thanks them.

## Features

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar shows links to each of the pages. It is fully responsive, turning into a hamburger menu on smaller screen sizes. 

### Hero section/ landing content
The content you see when you click on the website is an attractive hero image and hero text which gives the user immediate knowledge of the purpose of the site.

### Homepage
Under the hero section, the homepage is made up of three images with three short descriptions of different yoga styles to give the user information on the classes provided. Underneath this is a button which allows the user to book a class. The button is linked to the book a class page.


### About me page

### Book a class page 

### Footer
The footer is located at the bottom of the page and contains links to social media accounts.

### Responsiveness

### Future features
 I would like to implement the following features in the future to allow for an improved user experience:
 - Sign up and Login feature to allow users a personalised experience.
 - A feature which shows users previous classes and upcoming classes.
 - A loyalty scheme where the user gets every 6th class free if they sign up on the site.
